                Mr. Abdul Muqit Arief and also the Village Head. As of 2019, this area is only crooked land and was originally
                planned to be a swimming pool. However, this project was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Then in 2020,
                the administrator of this tourist attraction took the initiative to make this area a place of recreation.
                Therefore, this place was changed in such a way until the construction of the Puncak Badean was completed.
                And in September 2020, the establishment of the Puncak Badean tourist village was carried out by the program
                of the Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy program titled Indonesia BISA (Bersih, Indah, Sehat, dan Aman).
                Puncak Badean is one of the government's efforts to revive the tourism sector economy which is expected to support
                the economic income of the local community as well as Regional Original Income.
